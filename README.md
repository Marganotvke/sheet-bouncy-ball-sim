# sheet-bouncy-ball-sim
Simple python bouncy balls (particle) simulation on a perfect verticle plane with gravity. Uses pygamii(curses). Runs in terminal.

## Prerequisite
Install pygamii. Steps in its repository https://github.com/carlosmaniero/pygamii

## Problems
Due to the limitations of curses in general, the gravity simulations are quite inconsistant. Moreover, since you can't set gravity as float, it's makes the whole things less realistic. That being said, this is just a prove of concept.
